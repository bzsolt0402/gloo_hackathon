# Best Company of the World - Gloo Hackathon

At Bless Every Home we have close to 27,000 users actively praying for their neighbors by name every day, and about 1,000 churches actively managing the progress of these users. We also have nearly 70,000 prayer journal entries.

Our Hackathon solution aims to drive engagement and achieve 4 specific goals.

* Personalized daily __prayer prompts__
* Relatable church __sermon__ notes
* Relatable content through __YouVersion’s__ reading plans
* A powerful pool of data for __Gloo’s Data Exchange__

To achieve these goals we did the following.

* We built new user interfaces and backend systems to record prayer journal notes, individual prayer requests and real concerns of our churches.
* By feeding data to Chat GPT from these 3 sources, we create intentional, personalized and powerful daily prayer prompts for our users that address the real concerns of their neighbors and of their church.
* We had OpenAI generate vector embeddings of YouVersion’s Bible reading plans and of the real life concerns and prayer requests of our users. By calculating cosine similarities, we offer the most relevant YouVersion daily plan to each of our users. 
* With Chat GPT we identify the three most prevalent and current themes among church members, and offer for the churches, three distinct, fully developed sermon notes, that actually target the real and current concerns of their members.
* We send all anonymized prayer journal notes, individual prayer requests and current church concerns, with coordinates and organization identifiers to Gloo’s data exchange to facilitate possible further, very powerful usage of this data.
* All of this was implemented in both our mobile app and on the website, and is fully functional.
