God Is Love
 
 For most of my life I grew up hearing how angry God was with his creation especially humans and while I longed to serve and please God, I did it from a very unhealthy place of fear. I heard a lot about what was upsetting God and how my actions were causing his anger. I grew up without a father in my early years and then, later on, I lived with my stepfather who only caused further despair and damage to my view of a father figure. Besides my personal experiences and the teachings of God being angry all the time created a very warped view of love and more so the love of a male figure in my life.
 
 
 My approach to God was one of a distant relationship and as I mentioned my experiences with my earthly father figures made me comfortable with the view it was better to serve God from a distance and be content that if I didn't get everything right, I could expect judgment in my life. I lived with an expectation that things will always go wrong in my life because of the underlying truth I could not keep all God's commands, and just like my earthly father's dealing with me I could expect God the Father to do the same. I lived a very chaotic, depressed and hopeless life all the while being in the church. 
 
 
 I know the above scenario may not be so strange to many of you reading this plan and I hope that if you are still thinking or feeling this way about God the Father that your mindset will be changed and you will be set free from the bondage of fear. The scriptures declare, "God is love" (1 John 4:8 NIV). In 1 John 4:7 – 21 the words love, loves and loved is mentioned approximately twenty-seven times and the author; the Apostle John called himself the "Disciple whom God loved." (John 13:23 NIV). The Apostle John had such a profound revelation about the love of God he endured many hardships and persecutions. Without a revelation of who God is and how much he loves us it will be easy for the storms, trials, and persecutions of life to beat us down and keep us in fear of judgment and condemnation. The enemy of our soul thrives on keeping us ignorant of God's love to derail us from being all God made us to be. I trust today will be a new beginning for you as you venture out to see God as loving and kind and be led to fulfill your purpose in this life.
 
 The Greatest Commandment
 
 In the old covenant, the emphasis was on keeping the laws of God, the law keeping was laborious and burdensome, and the law also brought with it the sense of judgment which I mentioned in yesterday's reading. God's grace is far more superior to the laws, and even though the people of Israel had to keep the law, provisions were also made by way of the blood sacrifices for their failures. When Jesus came to the earth, he became that perfect sacrifice that would put us in right standing once and for all with God once we come by way of the blood of Jesus. However, the knowledge of good and evil is embedded in our nature and the flesh will always try to puff up to prove that we can keep the law be it through discipline or self-will, and this system causes us to look to ourselves for the answer rather than resting in God's love for us. 
 
 
 The leaders of the law in Jesus' time had major issues with the gospel Jesus was preaching and always sought an opportunity to ridicule him. One day while Jesus was teaching in the temple courts the teachers of the law approached him to question his authority, but Jesus always had an answer ready that most time quieted and angered them all simultaneously. The question was posed to Jesus, "Of all the commandments, which is the most important?" (Mark 12:28 NIV). Jesus' response was amazing, and every time I read it I must pause and drink in the depth of all that is contained within, "The most important one," answered Jesus, "is this: ‘Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one. Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.' The second is this: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.' There is no commandment greater than these." (Mark 12:29-31 NIV).
 
 
 Jesus summed up all the laws in the old covenant with just two and we translate those two laws in layman term as, "Love God; Love People." The truth about God is that he is love and he made us to love us not punish us. The bible tells us we are the object of his love, he created us to love us. Can you even fathom that thought, for me that was difficult to comprehend when all I had was heartache and rejection my whole life? Once I arrived at that place of understanding that no matter who rejected me or turned on me, God who is love made me just so he can love on me, oh that changed my life forever. The truth is we can never love God or people if we first don't know how much God loves us. I pray today you are gaining freedom from your past hurts and leaning in on the fact that God loves you.
 
 God Is Seen Through Our Love
 
 Today I would like to start by asking a simple question, "What draws you to someone you meet for the first time?" I don't think we give it much thought because we meet so many people in our lives occasionally but the common answer might be, "That person was so nice, so kind, so gracious, so welcoming, the smile was warm, or they had a sweet spirit." And this is how we describe people we are drawn too if they leave an impression on us. Well, this is how God said he would be known to the world and it will be through us. Jesus came to the earth to show forth the love of God to all humanity, but he also left his disciples with the same job description, "Go into all the world and preach the gospel to all creation." (Mark 16:15 NIV). In other words; do for the world what was done for you.
 
 
 The Apostle John emphasizes that no one has ever seen God, but if we love one another then God lives in us, and that will cause others to have a glimpse of God. (1 John 4:12 NIV). The sad reality of the state of believers and that includes me is that we are always looking for something more complex and profound to do to make our lives better and we forget our primary purpose is to be a witness for Jesus, representing him to a lost and broken world in such desperate need of love. In Jesus's time, there was no shortage of rules, regulations and organized religion and the people were burdened, exhausted and defeated by it all. Jesus came to relieve us from the heavy burdens of trying to fix our lives and keeping all the rules, there was no time for healthy community and relationships. What the world needed was not more rules but a savior to set them free and Jesus was that savior. I am saved today because of the love of Jesus displayed through a disciple of Jesus who took time to pray for and with me, listen and was patient with me through the process. While Jesus did not show up in person, I saw God through the love the person showed me.
 
 
 My friends, Jesus has done all that he can do to show his love, and he now wants to partner with you so his love can be made manifest to those around us. Sometimes we find it easier to preach to people about what they must do to get their lives right but according to the Apostle John, lives are changed when they encounter God and God is seen when people who don't know him see his children loving others, and that is the power of the gospel. John went so far to say, "Whoever claims to love God yet hates a brother or sister is a liar. For whoever does not love their brother and sister, whom they have seen, cannot love God, whom they have not seen" (1 John 4:20 NIV). The Apostle used strong, but necessary words and I pray that we will all aspire to love people the way God loves us.
 
 Ahavah
 
 In our culture, the word love is thrown around so freely and in the process loses its weight. We say things like, "I love that restaurant" or "I love that actor" or "I fell in love immediately, it was love at first sight." "I love that car or house." Love it seems has become so casual and is taken lightly. The way we use the word love, it suggests that love is temporary because when the next new thing or person comes around, we can forget the old and be in a new love relationship. Unfortunately, this is the world, but if you have been searching out a relationship with God, and the family of God you will understand that love is so much more than what is presented to us by our culture of the day.
 
 
 In the Hebrew language, the word for love is "Ahavah, " and it is very beautiful in meaning. The root word for Ahavah is ahav, and it means, "To give," so it is understood as "I give" and "I love" (Bloomfield). Love is, therefore, more than a feeling; it is an action word as well and is accompanied with giving. Bloomfield also states, "Love is giving. Not only is love giving, but the actual process of giving develops the very connection between the giver and the receiver." I find the truth embedded in this statement to be revolutionary because we live in a world where technology while it has excellent benefits also has the power to work against us. We have found ourselves caught in the worldwide web with so many connections yet we are still so disconnected from human touch and face to face conversations. While we enjoy hundreds of friendships on social media, we do not understand those people, and we must go with what they show us on their profiles. We have watered down our relationships to texts communications only because face to face meeting will only draw down on our time and it will mean we must be involved and give some of our time and attention away.
 
 
 "Giving is a condition that creates and sustains love. Without giving, there is no connection that is sustaining, and true relationships that are meaningful in our lives are those in which mutual giving take place" (Bloomfield).
 
 
 From this statement we can see that no relationship will ever be sustained unless we will give and keep on giving to the people we are involved with. Ahavah is the love by which God lives and exist; it's a love that cannot be earned and it is a love that keeps on giving. In the Old Testament time and time again God showed his people Ahavah, he loved them unconditionally, and he asked that they show that love to others. Perhaps you are in a relationship today on rocky ground, I want to encourage you to start the change in your relationship by asking yourself, "How can I Ahavah this person in my life today, what can I give to them?"
 
 Greek Words For Love
 
 There are quite a few words in the Greek language that describes the one word we use for love today, and I am very happy the Greek language can help us with the clarity which we so desperately need in this time when everyone loves everything. Today we will touch on four of those Greek words for insight and clarification.
 
 
 1. Eros - A Greek and Roman god of love, often called the son of Aphrodite. He is better known by his Roman name Cupid. Note: The word erotic comes from the Greek word eros, which is the term for sexual love itself, as well as the god's name ("eros." Collins English Dictionary). Eros can also be described as the love of the body or romantic love (Ichykoo). From these definitions, we can see that Eros is a passionate and intense love that arouses romantic feelings and is merely emotional and sexual and while having an attraction is vital at the beginning of relationships it is not enough to sustain it long term without commitment and giving.
 
 
 2. Phileo - refers to brotherly love and is most often exhibited in a close friendship. Best friends will display this generous and affectionate love for each other as each seeks to make the other happy - (www.gotquestions.org ). This love was seen in the relationship between David and Jonathan - (1 Samuel 18: 1- 3). We have the choice when it comes to phileo because its relationship is based on our likes and preferences.
 
 
 3. Storge - is an affectionate love, the type of love one might have for family or a spouse. It is a naturally occurring, unforced type of love. Some examples of storge love can be found in the stories of Noah, Jacob, and siblings, Mary, Martha, and Lazarus. (www.gotquestions.org). 
 
 
 4. Agape - speaks of the most powerful, noblest type of love: sacrificial love. Agape love is more than a feeling—it is an act of the will. This is the love that God has for his people, and that prompted the sacrifice of his only Son, Jesus, for our sins. Jesus was agape love personified. Christians are to love one another with agape love - (www.gotquestions.org ). There is no greater love than agape for it is the God kind of love and this is the love God the Father shows to us. Agape is always accompanied with giving and doing, and here we see agape, and Ahavah is the same love that will sustain our relationship with God and others summing up the greatest commandments – Love God; Love People!
